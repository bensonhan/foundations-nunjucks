        <p>Foundations Choreography offers dance training through our workshops and training teams.</p>

        <h1>Workshops</h1>
        <p>Throughout the year, Foundations Choreography holds free dance workshops, which are held at UCLA and are open to
            the public. Dedicated to exposing our dancers to various styles, we invite instructors from both within and outside
            the UCLA dance community to help build dance vocabulary, gain experience, and make connections with others in
            the world of dance. Check out our calendar for upcoming workshop dates and information!</p>
        <h1>Training Teams</h1>
        <p>FC training teams allow beginning and intermediate dancers to gain experience by being a part of a dance team. Every
            quarter, Foundations Choreography gathers experienced dancers in the community to direct our roughly 5 teams,
            each with about 40 members. Open to everyone to join on a first-come, first-serve basis, our training teams allow
            dancers to not only build technique and expand their dance background, but also attend inter-team bonding events
            and forge lifelong friendships. The FC training team experience culminates in an end-of-quarter exhibition in
            which dancers showcase a full set in front of friends and family. Whether through the team photoshoots and videos
            or the connections made with people from all backgrounds, Foundations Choreography offers a unique and memorable
            dance team experience here at UCLA.</p>
