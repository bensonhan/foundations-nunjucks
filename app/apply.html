                        Foundations Choreography was created as a space for beginning and intermediate dancers to grow, train, and challenge themselves. For us, as well as the many dancers who began their dance journey with Foundations Choreography, this organization was not just a space to train, but also our home. Over the years, Foundations Choreography has become the place where members form lasting friendships while also growing as dancers. Every quarter, we are amazed at the growth of our dancers - many of whom have never danced before. Some took the training that they received from Foundations Choreography and have even moved on to UCLA competitions teams; it is heartening to see these dancers are returning and giving back to the organization that gave them their start.
